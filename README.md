***EIR Champion web

This application is build using webpack and tailwind css. 

Using webapck we write less code and generate remaining based on the data. 
Also ejs provides us ability to use include and foreach within the html templates.
Offcourse we can generate the final static html by running `npm run build`


**Prerequisites
1. You should have nodejs installed
2. You should have npm which you will get withl nodejs

**Steps to run the application
1. Unzip the folder and navigate inside eir-champion-web in terminal or cmd
2. Run the command `npm install`
3. Run the command `npm run serve`
4. The application will be started and navigate to `http://localhost:9080`
5. You can also build the production version of with command `npm run build` which will create a dist folder with row html and css.
6. That's it.


Note: I have configured the project with webpack, tailwind css and ejs. Because I want to automate rework and tedius work using the tools.
